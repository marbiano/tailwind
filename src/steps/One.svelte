<h1 class="mb-20 text-yellow-black-dark">About UI Engineering</h1>
<p class="mb-8 ml-24">
  This is an exciting area to be working on lately. In the recent years there's
  been an boom of tools, ideas and methodologies that help us to move the
  industry forward. Stuff like:
</p>
<ul class="mb-8 ml-24 list-disc">
  <li class="mb-2">Shared best practices</li>
  <li class="mb-2">More robust algorithms</li>
  <li class="mb-2">Better starting points</li>
  <li class="mb-2">More complex user experiences</li>
  <li class="mb-2">Faster delivery times</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-8 ml-24">
  Now, I think all the above is truly beneficial, only if we are able to do all
  that without having to force the end user to to pay a penalty tax, for our own
  DX.
</p>
<p class="mb-8 ml-24">
  The future looks like deepening that initial wave of thinking, in order to
  make our work to be more about meeting users needs, while having at our
  disposal a set of tools that work with us in order to meet those needs.
</p>
<p class="mb-8 ml-24">
  <strong>tl;dr:</strong>
  as a developer, I want to keep feeling excited about building websites,
  without spending hours and hours tweaking toolsets. At the same time, I want
  the outcome to be as good and fast and as computationally possible.

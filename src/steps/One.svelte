<h1 class="mb-24 text-yellow-black-dark">What the future looks like to me?</h1>
<p class="mb-8 ml-24">
  In the recent years there's been an boom of tools, ideas and methodologies
  that helps us move forward. I specifically refer to stuff like:
</p>
<ul class="mb-8 ml-24 list-disc">
  <li class="mb-2">Shared best practices</li>
  <li class="mb-2">More robust algorithms</li>
  <li class="mb-2">Better starting points</li>
  <li class="mb-2">More complex user experiences</li>
  <li class="mb-2">Faster delivery times</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-8 ml-24">
  All the above is truly beneficial, only if we are able to do all that without
  having to force the end user to to pay a penalty tax, for our own DX.
</p>
<p class="mb-8 ml-24">
  The future to me looks more like deepening this initial wave of thinking, in
  order to make our work a more enjoyable, professional and shared practice,
  while delivering the kind of websites that the end user needs.

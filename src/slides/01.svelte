<h1>About the industry</h1>
<p>The web dev field seems to be at an interesting point of inflection.</p>
<p>
  While the past six or seven years have been all about growing up as an
  industry, today more and more people seem to be thinking about what’s coming
  next. Is the Javascript the ring that will rule them all forever? Is the
  Jamstack the best we can come up with? Or maybe it’s tiome for us to put our
  developer experience where it belongs, and leave the runtime to be a safe
  zone?
</p>
<p>
  No matter what the outcome will be, it’s pretty cleat that the rise of tools
  like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Netlify, Figma, Svelte, Snowpack and many others
  are helping the industry to move forward. We need to keep thinking about
  shipping early and often, while striving for high-quality performant websites.
</p>
<p>There’s work to be done. Exciting times are yet to come.</p>

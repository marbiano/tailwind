<h1>My thoughts on Tailwind</h1>
<p>You two seem like a bunch of lasers focused folks.</p>
<p>
  You create new things, you solve other people's problems, you actively
  participate in the community, all that while making a living of it.
</p>
<p>
  You also seem to release quality stuff. I was never a fan of CSS frameworks.
  But using Tailwind is a delight, one that reminds me of Compass in the old
  days. Refactoring UI seems very helpful. It's a reference that I would have
  loved to have while trying to learn how to design an interface.
</p>
<p>
  So yeah, you seem to have a ton of motivation, talent, and real challenges.
  And that profoundly inspires me.

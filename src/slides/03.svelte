<h1>About you</h1>
<p>You two (three now?) seem like a bunch of laser focused folks.</p>
<p>
  You invent things, you share stuff with other folks, you make a living of
  that, all that while actively participating with your peers. You really seem
  to be inspired people.
</p>
<p>
  You also seem to release quality stuff. I was never a fan of CSS frameworks.
  But using Tailwind brought me back the delightful experience I had while using
  Compass, only that much better because evolution has done its thing, as stated
  before.
</p>
<p>
  And Refactoring UI looks really good. Iâ€™d would have loved to have a reference
  like this when I was trying to teach myself not to such at designing an
  interface.
</p>
<p>
  So yeah, you really seem to have a ton of motivation, talent and challenges.
  And that deeply inspires me.
